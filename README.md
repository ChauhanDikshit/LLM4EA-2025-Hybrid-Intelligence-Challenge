### 🚀 About the Challenge

LLM4EA invites researchers, students, and professionals to explore intelligent hybrid solutions where LLMs contribute to evolutionary strategies in novel ways, such as:

- Metaheuristic design via prompts
- LLM-guided operator selection
- Problem decomposition
- Real-world application cases

📅 Event Timeline, tracks, registration, and prize info are all available on the [landing page](https://chauhandikshit.github.io/llm4ea/).
